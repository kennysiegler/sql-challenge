# sql-challenge
##Description
This is my submission for the module 9 SQL challenge. This acitivity aims to improve my understanding of database creation and structuring.

##Usage
This activity is pretty simple, theres a folder that holds all of the data, a folder with my sqlite file, and a folder with the entity relationship diagram. You should be able to open the sqlite file and run each query by selecting only the code from the query and hitting the play button. Each query has a note above it explaining the desired output.
